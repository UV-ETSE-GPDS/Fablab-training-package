The pinout of the used ESP12-E module is in the esp12e-pinout.png. Please note that the NodeMCU gpio numbering does not match with the original pinout, look at the https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/gpio/ for detailed description.

The code is in the init.lua file. It requires NodeMCU firmware v1.0 or higher with modules: adc, gpio, file, net,node,timer,wifi
